# project-recommendations-site

This repository contains the "built" versions of the Markdown files for
OSVTAC's open source voting system project recommendations. (OSVTAC stands
for San Francisco's [Open Source Voting System Technical Advisory
Committee][osvtac].)

The "source" Markdown files for the recommendations are located in the
following repository: <https://github.com/OSVTAC/project-recommendations>. If
you would like to contribute suggestions on the recommendations themselves,
you should consult the `README` file of that repository.

The repository for OSVTAC's website includes the repository you are currently
viewing as a submodule: <https://github.com/OSVTAC/OSVTAC.github.io>. The
Markdown gets converted to HTML on the server side by [GitHub
Pages][gitHub-pages] when the website repository is published to the web.

The remainder of this README includes instructions for rebuilding the
Markdown files (i.e. updating the contents of this repository) prior to
committing, as well as previewing these files in a browser to check that
things are working before pushing.
