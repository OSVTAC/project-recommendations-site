## 2. Goals

This section discusses the goals, scope, and priorities of this document and
the Committee.

The TAC’s Bylaws say that the TAC’s purpose is to “provide technical
guidance, ideas, and support to the Elections Commission on ways to improve
and help ensure the success of the City and County of San Francisco's open
source voting system project.” The focus of TAC's effort will be on
establishing parameters and recommendations to guide the future development
of the voting system.

The TAC will draw on its technical expertise, the expertise of other members
in the community, and from similar efforts (including other open source
voting efforts) to provide guidance in areas including but not limited to
open source, requirements-gathering, design, architecture, development,
documentation, security, testing, certification, manufacturing, deployment,
system maintenance, strategies for procurement, and project management.


### 2.1. Scope

1. This document will limit itself to current laws that San Francisco must
  satisfy, or to changes in law that San Francisco anticipates (e.g. possibly
  transitioning to the “vote center” model allowed by [SB
  450][bill-sb-450-2015] of 2015-2016). In particular, the document will
  restrict itself to considering paper-ballot systems.

2. For the purposes of this document, “voting system” includes anything that
  is currently the responsibility of the voting system in use today.
  Responsibilities of a voting system include allowing voters to mark ballots
  (if not using pen and paper), counting ballots, reporting election
  results, and ensuring the integrity of the process.
  In addition, it may include ballot design and layout, as well as
  the functionality of a “remote accessible vote by mail system” as described
  in [AB 2252][bill-ab-2252-2015] (2015-2016). It should also facilitate
  auditing the results of an election. The responsibilities of a voting
  system do not include the responsibilities of a voter registration system.
  The voting system may need to interoperate with the Department’s EIMS®
  application. If the ballots
  are pre-printed, the voting system need not be capable of printing ballots.


### 2.2. Priorities

1. This document should prioritize high-level recommendations over low-level
  recommendations.

2. This document should prioritize recommendations that are needed sooner
  rather than later.


### 2.3. Non-goals

1. The Committee will not be designing or developing a voting system.

2. The Committee will not be drafting detailed, low-level specs that the
  voting system should satisfy.

3. The Committee will not be drafting an exhaustive list of requirements.

4. The Committee will not be recommending particular vendors. However, the
  Committee may evaluate particular _systems_.

5. The Committee will not make explicit attempts to accommodate internet
  voting in any form, nor voting methods not used in San Francisco. This does
  not preclude the Committee from recommending software designs or practices
  that could make such things easier to accommodate as a side effect.

6. The Committee's recommendations will prioritize the voting system needs of
  San Francisco without emphasizing the needs of other jurisdictions.
  The needs of other
  jurisdictions will be considered insofar as it could help to develop and
  certify a system for use in San Francisco sooner (for example, if San
  Francisco were to collaborate with another jurisdiction and share costs).
  However, as stated in the previous point, this does not preclude
  recommending designs and practices that could make it easier to accommodate
  other jurisdictions.
